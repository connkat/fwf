# FWF

## The Freezerburn Wrestling Federation Official Website

I noticed my pals at the FWF didn't have a website so I took the liberty of purchasing [freezerburnwrestlingfederation.com](www.freezerburnwrestlingfederation.com) and creating the worst possible website in the shortest amount of time. 

## Dev Info 

Created using CRA, TS, with party-mode inspiration from my pal [Seb](https://github.com/usernameseb).
